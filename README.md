# ligature-specification

A formal-ish specification for [Ligature](https://ligature.dev).

Status: All these docs are still under heavy development and very likely to change often.

This documentation is split up into multiple parts.
 - [ligature-model.md](ligature-model.md) - this is the main specification for Ligature's data model
 - [ligature-format.md](ligature-format.md) - a specification for a simple serialization format for Ligature
 - [wander.md](wander.md) - a specification for the Wander scripting language, that is used to interact with Ligature
