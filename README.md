# ligature-specification
A formal-ish specification for Ligature.

Status:  All these docs are still under heavy development and very likely to change often.

This documentation is split up into multiple parts.
 - [ligature.md](ligature.md) - this is the main specification for Ligature itself
 - [lig.md](lig.md) - a specification for a simple serialization format for Ligature named Lig
 - [ligature-http.md](ligature-http.md) - a specification for working with Ligature via http
 - [wander.md](wander.md) - a specification for the Wander scripting language, that is used to interact with Ligature
