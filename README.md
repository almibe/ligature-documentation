# ligature-specification

A formal-ish specification for [Ligature](https://ligature.dev).

Status: All these docs are still under heavy development and very likely to change often.

This documentation is split up into multiple parts.
 - [ligature.md](ligature.md) - specification for Ligature's data model
 - [wander.md](wander.md) - specification for the Wander scripting language, that is used to interact with Ligature
 - [functions.md](functions.md) - the core functions used to work with Ligature's data model
